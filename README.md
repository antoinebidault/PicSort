# PicSort
Windows form C# Utility to sort pictures by year and then by month. 

I'm a very lazy person, that's why I hate sorting pictures in folder.
I then built this little windows utility to automatically sort my pictures in correctly named folders.
The pictures are automatically renamed with unique name based on the date, hours, minutes, size. You can do the process multiple times with the same input folder without doublon.
I tried it with a 10gb images folders with crappy folders name and it worked perfectly.
